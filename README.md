### Spotify EDA with Pandas

#### Overview
This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset containing information about tracks on Spotify, including details such as artist name, track name, release date, genres, and various audio features. The analysis will utilize the Pandas library in Python to explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

#### Contents
- `spotify_eda.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, and analysis.
- `spotify_data.csv`: Dataset file containing Spotify data in CSV format.

#### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `spotify_eda.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis process.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.
4. Modify and customize the analysis as needed for your own exploration.

#### Dependencies
The analysis is performed using the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
